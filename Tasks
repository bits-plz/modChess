if it is a white piece make a small black circle on the canvas
if white then make a white circle                                                       DONE

stack of moves implementation so that we can go back and forth                          DONE

    Well for now i can just maintain a move list , you can go bac and forth till last played move,
    but once you make a new move all the moves from that point on gets spliced and the new move is added to move list.
    well it should be like if white likes to go back he can and so can white, but white can't undo black's move
    and when white undoes then there should be a button that white requests black to also undo, but it is upto him, he may choose
    not to do so, as these UNDOs will have a cost to them 
    it will be a point based game, winning like in normal chess will give 1000 points,
    undo costs 50 points, and so on 

        Capturing queen gives 500 points
        Capturing bishop 100 points
        Capturing knight 50 points
        Capturing  rook 120 points.

        So you see even if you win if the opponent captures more valuable pieces chances are that he can also win the game.
        like normally it's the game of points and it is

The pieces in white, black can be stored in a map and then it can contain arrays, 
so that when later a piece is killed it can be easily                                                   TO DO
